<p><h1>Bias Tyre Market Size, Market Share and Global Market Analysis Report, 2025 - 2032</h1></p><p><strong>Bias Tyre Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Bias tyres, also known as bias-ply tyres, are constructed with layers of rubber-coated fabric plies arranged diagonally at an angle to the tyre's centerline. This design provides durability and strength, making them suitable for heavy-duty applications such as agricultural, industrial, and off-road vehicles. However, they are less efficient in terms of fuel economy and heat dissipation compared to radial tyres.</p><p>The Bias Tyre Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.6% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by increasing demand from emerging economies, particularly in the agriculture and construction sectors, where bias tyres are preferred for their robustness and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, advancements in tyre manufacturing technologies have improved the performance and lifespan of bias tyres, further boosting their adoption.</p><p>Recent trends in the bias tyre market include the development of eco-friendly materials and sustainable manufacturing processes to meet environmental regulations. There is also a growing focus on enhancing tyre durability and load-bearing capacity to cater to heavy-duty applications. The market is witnessing increased competition, with manufacturers investing in research and development to innovate and differentiate their products. Overall, the bias tyre market is poised for steady growth, supported by industrial expansion and technological advancements.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bias Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Black</li><li>Non-marking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bias tires are constructed with crisscrossed layers of rubber-coated fabric plies, offering durability and load-bearing capacity. In the market, they are categorized into two types: Black and Non-marking. Black bias tires are standard, made with carbon black, providing strength and resistance to wear. Non-marking bias tires, often used in indoor or clean environments, are made without carbon black, leaving no scuff marks on surfaces. Both types cater to specific applications, balancing performance and surface protection based on user needs.</p></p>
