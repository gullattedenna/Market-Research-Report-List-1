<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biofertilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nitrogen-Fixing</li><li>Phosphate-Solubilizing</li><li>Potash-Mobilizing</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biofertilizer market includes nitrogen-fixing, phosphate-solubilizing, potash-mobilizing, and other types. Nitrogen-fixing biofertilizers contain microorganisms like Rhizobium and Azotobacter, which convert atmospheric nitrogen into plant-usable forms, enhancing soil fertility. Phosphate-solubilizing biofertilizers use microbes such as Pseudomonas and Bacillus to release bound phosphorus, improving nutrient availability. Potash-mobilizing biofertilizers employ fungi and bacteria to solubilize potassium, aiding plant growth. Other biofertilizers include zinc and sulfur solubilizers, which enhance micronutrient uptake. These eco-friendly solutions promote sustainable agriculture by reducing chemical fertilizer dependency and improving soil health.</p></p>
