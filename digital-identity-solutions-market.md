<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Identity Solutions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biometrics</li><li>Non-biometrics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital Identity Solutions can be categorized into two main types: biometrics and non-biometrics. Biometrics involves using unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, to verify a person's identity. This approach provides high-security levels due to its reliance on inherent traits. Non-biometrics, on the other hand, encompasses identification methods such as passwords, PINs, and security questions, relying on knowledge-based authentication. While biometrics offer enhanced security, non-biometrics allows for easier implementation and user familiarity.</p></p>
