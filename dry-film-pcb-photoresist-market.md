<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Film PCB Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive</li><li>Negative</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dry film PCB photoresist market is segmented into two main types: positive and negative photoresists. Positive photoresists become soluble when exposed to UV light, allowing the unexposed areas to be washed away, thus creating clear circuitry patterns. In contrast, negative photoresists harden upon exposure, leaving the unexposed areas to be removed, which results in a more durable pattern. Both types are essential in PCB manufacturing, catering to various applications based on desired resolution and processing requirements.</p></p>
