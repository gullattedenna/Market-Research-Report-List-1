<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The H-Pylori Noninvasive Diagnostic Tests Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Serology Test</li><li>Stool Antigen Test</li><li>Urea Breath Test</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The H. pylori noninvasive diagnostic tests market includes three primary types: serology tests, stool antigen tests, and urea breath tests. Serology tests detect antibodies against H. pylori in the blood, indicating past or current infection. Stool antigen tests identify H. pylori proteins in fecal samples, providing evidence of active infection. Urea breath tests assess the presence of H. pylori by measuring the breakdown of ingested urea, which releases labeled carbon dioxide if the bacteria are present. These tests offer reliable alternatives to invasive procedures.</p></p>
