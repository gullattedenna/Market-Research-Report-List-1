<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical External Defibrillator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-Automatic Defibrillator</li><li>Automatic Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Medical External Defibrillator market is primarily divided into two types: semi-automatic and automatic defibrillators. Semi-automatic defibrillators require the operator to initiate the shock after analyzing the heart rhythm, providing guidance through voice prompts. In contrast, automatic defibrillators analyze the rhythm and deliver shocks autonomously without operator intervention. This differentiation caters to various user scenarios, with semi-automatic models offering manual control and automatic models ensuring rapid response, enhancing patient outcomes in cardiac emergencies.</p></p>
