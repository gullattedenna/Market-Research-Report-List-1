<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Kidney Dialysis Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical kidney dialysis machines market includes two primary types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis involves using a machine to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood through an artificial kidney, typically performed in a clinic or at home. In contrast, peritoneal dialysis utilizes the lining of the abdominal cavity as a filter, where a dialysis solution is infused, absorbing waste before being drained out. Both methods cater to patients with kidney failure, offering distinct advantages and treatment preferences.</p></p>
