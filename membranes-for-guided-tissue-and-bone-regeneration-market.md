<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membranes for Guided Tissue and Bone Regeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Membrane</li><li>Non-resorbable Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The membranes for guided tissue and bone regeneration are categorized into absorbable and non-resorbable types. Absorbable membranes are designed to degrade naturally in the body over time, eliminating the need for a second surgical procedure, and they support tissue healing while promoting regeneration. In contrast, non-resorbable membranes remain in place indefinitely and often require surgical removal after tissue healing. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing healing processes and ensuring proper tissue regeneration in dental and orthopedic applications.</p></p>
