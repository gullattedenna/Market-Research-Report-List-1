<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retinal Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Epiretinal Implants</li><li>Subretinal Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The retinal implants market is primarily categorized into epiretinal and subretinal implants. Epiretinal implants are placed on the surface of the retina and process visual information from the external environment, transmitting it directly to the retinal cells. In contrast, subretinal implants are situated beneath the retina and work by stimulating the retinal cells more closely, offering a more natural visual experience. Both types aim to restore vision for individuals with retinal degenerative diseases, enhancing their quality of life through advanced technology.</p></p>
